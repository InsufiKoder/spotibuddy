# SpotiBuddy
An express.js app that displays friend status. This will be the initial and last commit i will make on this project (Maybe some small edits/fixes).

The code is messy, i know.

I didn't try this code with more than one friend, you might need to edit it to make it work correctly.

Python scripts are from the repository below. This project wouldn't exist if it weren't for the author.

# Usage
**You need to have node.js and python installed on your machine.**

Get the **sp_dc** cookie from the spotify website after you login from your browser's cookie storage.

Paste it into the **.env.example** file. **Rename it to .env**

Run **npm i** to install the project's dependencies.

Run **pip install requests pyotp** to install python's dependencies.

Run **npm start** to start the webserver. It will be available at **localhost:3000**.

You *might* get banned from using this, so it *might* be better using an alt account.
