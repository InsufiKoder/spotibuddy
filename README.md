# SpotiBuddy
An express.js app that displays friend status. This will be the initial and last commit i will make on this project (If we don't count the readme commit).

The code is messy, i know.

I didn't try this code with more than one friend, you might need to edit it to make it work correctly.

Python scripts are from the repository below. This project wouldn't exist if it weren't for the author.

# Usage
Get the sp_dc cookie from the spotify website after you login from your browser's cookie storage.

Paste it into the .env.example file. Rename it to .env

Run **npm i** to install the project's dependencies.

Run **npm start** to start the webserver. It will be available at **localhost:3000**.

You *might* get banned from using this, so it might be better using an alt account.
